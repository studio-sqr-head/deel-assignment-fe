## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Notes

- This was timeboxed at 3 hours exactly. I spent an hour on the questions and two hours on the component.

- I did not get to the following:
  - Add tests
  - Add debounce method to endpoints.
  - Profile and optimize the component
